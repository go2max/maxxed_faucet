This is my adaptation on this frontend template. I will begin working on it this week. 

I am aiming to make a faucet that gives away crypto. Since I have found Duino Coin this week I have become obsessed and want to allow others the opportunity to get into an amazing ground breaking project. It allows almost anyone in the world to have access to start mining crypto as well as coding and many other features. 

I am currently mining with:
a 2019 macbook air (background process)
3x web miners
5x ESP32 boards
